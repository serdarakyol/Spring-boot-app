# Spring-boot-app

This application does CRUD, created to learn Spring boot and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I included design pattern, unit testing, performance testing, test coverage report, binary file help to developers, and Docker. I have started to this application from [Spring Boot Tutorial | Full Course [2022] [NEW]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SGDpanrc8U&ab_channel=Amigoscode) by [Amigoscode](https://www.youtube.com/@amigoscode) and improved.

## Test
[Locust](https://github.com/locustio/locust) have been used for performans testing. To test the API, run `./project-dev performans-test`

## Usage
Docker Desktop must be installed. To run the app use below command.

```
$ sudo ./project-dev code-run
```

Ready to go. Just click [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html) and test the API. Do not hesitate to create an issue to improve my skills, please.
